# Progressive `useFetcher`

Ryan Florence (@ryanflorence) promotes a three-step process to create user experiences:

1. Make it work without JavaScript
2. Enhance the experience with JavaScript
3. Move as much logic as possible to the server

Remix provides all the tools to follow through with this process.

In this project, I want to look at the second step: enhancing the experience with JavaScript. Specifically, I want to look at how to use `useFetcher` to progressively enhance the experience.
